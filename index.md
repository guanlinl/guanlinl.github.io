# About me
I’m currently Head of Quantitative Research for Automated Market Making at [SDIC Group](https://www.sdic.com.cn/en/) Securities Investment. Previously, I was on the equity derivatives and options market making team at [China Securities Co., Ltd](https://www.csc108.com/newsiteindex/index.jspx). Before that, I worked at [CTC Trading Group](https://www.chicagotrading.com), a proprietary trading firm in Chicago. My focus has been on researching systematic options trading strategies and high-frequency market-making algorithms.

### Academic background
I graduated with a Bachelor's degree in Mathematics, with a minor in Physics, from Arizona State University (_summa cum laude_, May 2016). I then went on to earn three Master's degrees: in Mathematics (May 2017), Electrical & Computer Engineering (May 2020), and Statistics (May 2021), followed by a Ph.D. in Quantitative Biosciences from the School of Physics at Georgia Institute of Technology (June 2021). My Ph.D. research, supervised by Dr. Joshua S. Weitz and Dr. Yao Yao, focused on the understanding and control of complex biological, sociological, and physical systems. Examples of such systems include microbial ecosystems (e.g., virus-host interactions), public health (e.g., infectious disease control), and public policy (e.g., collective behavior in voting).
