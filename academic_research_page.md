## Spatial Models, Pattern Formation and Nonlinear Dynamics

### Phase separation in spatial coordination games

Microbes interact in dense environments. These interactions can span antagonistic to cooperative, and can vary between and across microbial types. Microbes could utilize a proximity-based secretion system to kill individuals of other types without killing microbes of the same type. Such strain-dependent killing led to the emergence of distinct patches which grew in size and structure with spatiotemporal dynamics whose scaling was consistent with [_'Model A' Coarsening_](https://sethna.lassp.cornell.edu/Coarsening/What_Is_Coarsening.html) (see time lapse images below from a simulation, two groups of microbes are labeled in red and blue). We proposed a stochastic spatial game-theoretic framework (focusing our attention on [_coordination games_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coordination_game)) to model this microbial system, and study the emergence of _coarsening_ using a mean-field approach, manuscript available upon request.

### Spatial dynamics of two competing species with mutually repulsive chemotaxis 
Bacteria can sense a vast range of environmental signals, such as concentrations of nutrients, toxins, or oxygen levels, pH levels, and they can exhibit chemotactic movements either towards or away from a signal. Here, we study a system of PDEs modelling the population dynamics of two competitive species whose spatial movements are governed by both diffusion and mutually repulsive [chemotaxis](http://2016.igem.org/Team:Technion_Israel/Chemotaxis) effects.

### Consensus in networked multiagent systems
Mathematical models of [_opinion formation_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Consensus_decision-making) have long been objects of theoretical interest. The rise of social networks as some of the main forums for the exchange of ideas clearly motivates the need to continue the study of these models. The defining feature of the agent-based approach is the study of _how locally defined interaction rules affect globally observed behavior among the agents_. Here, we propose and study a variant of bounded confidence dynamics with the goal of inducing unconditional convergence to a consensus. The defining feature of these dynamics which we name the _"No one left behind dynamics"_ is the introduction of a local control on the agents which preserves the connectivity of the interaction network.
